package main

import "fmt"
//to use fmt package we need to import it

// this is starting of the program, program start from func main(){}(like in any other language)

func main() {
	//fmt stands for formatting 
	fmt.Println("hello world")
	//println works like as it works in java 
	fmt.Printf("Hello")
	//printf works like as it works in c++ we can use %T, %v ...etc
}
